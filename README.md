🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Python

💡 This is a simple movie recommendation system built using Python. The system suggests movies based on user preferences, focusing on improving movie discovery. 
The recommendation is powered by analyzing data using basic Python libraries and a simple collaborative filtering approach.

🧐 In today’s world, with the growing number of movies and shows available on streaming platforms, users often feel overwhelmed and struggle to decide what to watch next. 
Recommendation systems help make this process easier by suggesting movies based on preferences and previous behavior.

🎯 The task was to build a movie recommendation system in Python that would:
Suggest relevant movies based on user input.
Utilize movie data to find patterns or similarities among movies.
Provide a simple and scalable way for users to discover movies they might like.

🛠️ I followed these steps to build the recommendation system:
Data Collection: I used a dataset of movies with metadata (e.g., genres, ratings, etc.) from MovieLens or a similar dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted the data using Pandas, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset for easier analysis.
Recommendation: Based on the similarity in genres and ratings of the movies, the system recommends movies with the highest similarity to the user's input.

🎉The system successfully suggests movies based on user input and movie similarity. Users are able to discover relevant movies with personalized suggestions.
